# To-Do-List-App
Contain files used in creating a web based To-Do list using JavaScript

# Overview

My software is To-do list app. This to-do list allows users to add, remove, update, and mark tasks as completed. I used HTML for the structure, CSS for the styling and UI. The to-do list is running on a JavaScript engine. Some of the features of the to-do list includes a section displaying list of tasks, with the option to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed. It also has a section that allows input for new tasks through a text based field and a button to "add" the new tasks to the list of tasks. Each task also have the ability to deleted at the disposal of the user.

The aim of every software is to solve a problem. Because i can be very unorganized and often spend much time on tasks requiring less time, I created the To-do list app to help me organize my tasks and give me an idea of what i need to do and to also sort them according to how important they are.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

To develop this software, i used VS Code as my IDE, and employed the use of some VS code extensions to maximize my productivity.

I used JavaScript majorly to complete this software. Because it is web-based app, i made use of HTMl for structure and CSS for styling, as well as for DOM structure. I did not make use of any library or framework whilst working on this app.

# Future Work

- I plan to add a time-based deadline to each of tasks that cancels a time when i am not able to complete it in the alloted time.

- Subsequently, I plan to include a weather map, location, and time zone that would sync with the time-based deadlines that i would be adding to the app.
